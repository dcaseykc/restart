The IHME and MIT max COVID patients needing a hospital bed figures were placed into `config.yaml` (the old `config.yaml` lives in `../config/old-v2.3` and we'll probably go back to using that again after this is done). In addition, various RAND and CAN scenarios were pulled manually directly from the CalCat website and placed into the model, using the upper bounds. Some of these should probably be pruned out, as (by design) some are unrealistically high and then we're also taking an upper bound on top of that.
