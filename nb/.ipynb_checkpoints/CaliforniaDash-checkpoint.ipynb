    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting for the future Fall 2020 is difficult. This is a quick survey of the available data. We have looked through both CalCat and our other models. Here are the challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Long-term hospitalizations have high error bands. We are looking at estimates of hospitalizations that is months in the future. Given the exponential spread of COVID-19, even being off slightly now can result in very large changes. As an example, if we have uncontrolled infection that doubles every week, in three weeks, we could 8x the infection of today.\n",
    "2. We are using historical rates of ventilator usage (based on IHME assumptions). These rates change ventilator requires substantially. And the population that gets sick changes the rates at which patients enter the ICU. IMHE currently uses a 90% ventilator use of ICU patients and a 27% rate that patients enter the ICU. These are very conservative figures.\n",
    "3. The Uncertainty for this infection is very high. Even the traditional 95% uncertainty range is very hard to estimate because we are modeling an infection that has little historical data and we do now know how compliance will be in the future. These forecasts are heavily dependent on social behavior which is inherently hard to model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given all this, we have modeled a few figures and provided a calculator where you can examine assumptions:\n",
    "1. When we look at forecast bands such as with IHME, RAND or COVID Action Network (CAN) data, we assume a \"triangle distribution\" that is we assume we do not go above their high forecast. In reality, there is an unknown probability that we can have breakthrough, so we should take those high figures as optimistic and you may want to have a buffer against the high figure.\n",
    "2. Given this, the estimates show a large high-end range of 9-17K ventilators required. However, if the parameters are incorrect, then we could easily exceed those figures. Obviously these figures are much higher that the 1.5K ventilators that is the current peak, but all the models show the potential for widespread infection in the fall. And this does not model other uses of ventilators. it is only for incremental COVID demand.\n",
    "3. Finally, the allocation of ventilators can also be off and given the large geographic area that is California, it is possible to have enough ventilators, but they are in the wrong places. That makes having a buffer even more important."

These are again subject to different population behavior and also make assumptions about how the disease progresses, so you need to take them with a large grain of salt.\n",
