    "As part of the Fall preparation sprint, we spent the last ten days analyzing what it will take to beat the infection decisively this fall. There are three fundamental ideas:\n",
    "1. Backstop. Have a backstop that protects hospitals in the unlikely event, they outstrip their ability to procure the right resources. They are our last line of defense against the infection.\n",
    "2. Purchasing Cooperative. For smaller groups that have funds, but who can benefit from the aggregation of supply. This will protect an important group that is upstream of hospitals.\n",
    "3. Protecting the most vulnerable. The infection starts at this front line. We need to defend the most vulnerable against the infection. Not only does this reduce the disease burden, it also increases employment and takes the pressure off our relief efforts. Winning upstream, winning at the front lines, that is the key to victory.\n",
