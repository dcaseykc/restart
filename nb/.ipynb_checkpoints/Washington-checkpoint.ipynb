    "# Washington Group 1, 2 and 3 Preliminary Analysis\n",
    "## 20 August 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the Fall preparation sprint, we spent the last ten days analyzing what it will take to beat the infection decisively this fall. There are three fundamental ideas:\n",
    "1. Backstop. Have a backstop that protects hospitals in the unlikely event, they outstrip their ability to procure the right resources. They are our last line of defense against the infection.\n",
    "2. Purchasing Cooperative. For smaller groups that have funds, but who can benefit from the aggregation of supply. This will protect an important group that is upstream of hospitals.\n",
    "3. Protecting the most vulnerable. The infection starts at this front line. We need to defend the most vulnerable against the infection. Not only does this reduce the disease burden, it also increases employment and takes the pressure off our relief efforts. Winning upstream, winning at the front lines, that is the key to victory.\n",

    "# Group 1 Backstop to Large Providers\n",
    "These are the large hospitals and other facilities that take care of our sickest patients. With the fall, we will face the difficult challenge of both the flu season and the recurrence of COVID-19 as the climate worsens and people move indoors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This group will provide most of their own PPE, disinfection and other resources with the state acting as a backstop in extreme emergencies. Given the exponential nature of infection, we need this backstop because even the best predictions have a large variance. For example, if the disease doubles every week, then even a two week error in estimate will increase PPE requirements in COVID wards by 4x.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Group 2 Aggregate Demand of Smaller Providers\n",
    "\n",
    "This second group consists of several different populations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smaller health care providers such as hospitals with 299 beds or less\n",
    "- long-term care providers and nursing homes\n",
    "- behavioral health facilities\n",
    "- dentists\n",
    "- morticians\n",
    "- Federally Qualified Health Centers [FQHC](https://www.hrsa.gov/opa/eligibility-and-registration/health-centers/fqhc/index.html) community health providers\n",
    "- public health organizations,\n",
    "- tribal clinics\n",
    "- independent physician practices\n",
    "- First responders including EMOs, police, fire\n",
    "\n",
    "We use two different methods to estimate these populations. More detailed surveys and census methods are also possible, so consider these methods as ways to get a broad measure of the scope of the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Employee Classification (SOC) Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "SOC codes starting with \"29-\", \"31-\", and \"33-\" refer to, respectively, healthcare occupations, healthcare support occupations, and protection services. We estimate of the percentage of healthcare workers or healthcare-support workers fall into the Group 2 category, and simply scale all the numbers by that amount. It seems like a safe assumption that all the protection services would fall into this group. \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis provides the stockpile that you would need to 100% cover the group for 30 days. A key policy decision is the size of the back stop needed. If you want to cover 50% of the demand for 30 days, then the figures would be half that.\n"
