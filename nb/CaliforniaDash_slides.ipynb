    "Quick overview of the current state of this document: the notebook code here walks you through the methodology and assumptions made, and then the very last cell is an `ipyvuetify` implementation of everything so it hopefully looks pretty. That might be a good place for you to put the final documentation. Also, if you run `voila` on this notebook with the template `vuetify-default` (you might need to `pip install voila-vuetify`), then it won't display any of the stuff not in that cell. \n",

    "Code to fetch the IHME and MIT numbers is in `src/extern/data/epidemiological` (written by Ethan). He has mentioned that the MIT projections have a peak in August and are monotically decreasing ever since, so maybe we should drop those. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, various RAND and CAN scenarios were pulled manually directly from the CalCat website and placed into the model, using the upper bounds. Some of these should probably be pruned out, as (by design) they are unrealistically high and then we're also taking an upper bound on top of that. We use the hack of representing these demands in our population module. \n",

    "Also, I think it might be a good idea to just ditch the California non-COVID projection and burn rates as it causes a few issues:\n",
    "    \n",
    "   1. There's the issue of us not having ventilator burn rates for non-COVID patients, so it's kind of awkward to have a `0` in that spot.\n",
    "   2. There's no upper or lower bounds on it, so it doesn't fit very nicely into the range scheme\n",

They *are* pretty much straight from the horse's mouth, but it might be wise for us to be clear about the source so that, as an organization, we're a bit insulated from them."
