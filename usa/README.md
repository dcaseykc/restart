## Hispanic analysis (@mitch 2020-06-04)
I saw on the Trello board a task tile under the "Messaging, PR, and Legal" assigned to me to summarize Hispanic demographics. 
Attached to this note is a very brief summary of Hispanic demographics.
I also included a short paragraph on acculturation and language preferences, which may inform our messaging.
In addition, I included a chart as an example of the seasonal labor force experienced in places like Yakima compared to Olympia.
This is intended to help ground our point of view and understanding of Hispanics with data instead of
general impressions should someone challenge or probe us in this area.
