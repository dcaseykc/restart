# COVID-19 Restart the World

Getting the world up and running again isn't going to be easy. This project is a start at making that easier. Feel free to take pieces and contribute. While we wait for an effective treatment or a vaccine, we need all these pieces to save lives from the infection and get the economy back to work.

It has three major components:

1. Modeling the Need. Model the entire world of the COVID-19 response from the epidemeological models, to the consumer confidence model and finally to the supply chain models that estimate how much Personal Protective Equiptment (PPE), Test kits and other equipment is needed to make it work.
2. Changing Norms. No amount of equipment works without changing how people work, live and play. This is a set of behavioral models and content that works against the different segments that need to be protected. From children, to the elderly to specific groups that are disportionately effect, getting the right message at the right time is key.
3. Providing the Material. This so confusing that having a set of templates that you can embed into any website to provide the latest training, the condensed recommendation is critical. And then on the backend a marketplace that is easy to setup so you can buy or download what you need in one step.
