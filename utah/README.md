# Utah Hilburn Model

I have streamlined the process so that it takes me less than one minute to build a model per state / region. Rich, in the process of building a model for Wisconsin, it made sense to go ahead and standardize it, though I am sure it is not as good as what you would have developed!
 
Obviously the SOC / NAICS makeup per state / region is going to make this model slightly off from state to state, but I think the simplicity and turn-key nature of the model makes the margin of error trivial.
 
If we feel we need to better account for the differences in industry makeup per region, we could create five models and stratify states into 5 Hachman Index strata. I have attached what those strata could look like, with brackets to include states with indices with a +/- of 10 Hachman Index points. The base states could be:
 
·         Wyoming (1)
·         Alaska (1)
·         Delaware (4)
·         Nebraska (10)
·         Virginia (34)
 
In other words, Wyoming and Alaska would need their own models, since their Hachman Indices are so different from other states. Four states could use the “Delaware” model, 10 states could use the “Nebraska” model, and 34 states could use the “Virginia” model. Washington, Wisconsin, and Utah would all fall under the “Virginia” model, which makes sense and it makes me think the Utah model may not work well for Wyoming, given that Utah has the highest Hachman Index and Wyoming has the lowest. I think conducting the analysis on Wyoming manually, and also with this model, is the test of whether we need more than one model.
