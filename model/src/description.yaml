Description:
  "Population p":
    "Attributes pd": |
      ## Population Details (pd)
      There are p Populations in the model and each population
      can have d details about them such as their degree of age,
      ethnicity, attitudes and awareness behaviors
    "Protection pm": |
      ## Population to Protection Level (pm)
      For each p Populations falls into which protection
      category m for the burn rates
    "Protection Demand mn": |
      ## Population by Level demand for Resources (mn)
      The burn rates per capita for resources
      For example, 1.18 would mean you need 1.18 N95 masks per day for a
      given population
    "Population Demand pn": |
      ## Population Demand for each of n Resources (pn)
      This is the per capita demand for a give population so this is not the per
      capita demand but for every n Resource for ever subpopulation p
    "Population to Level pl": |
      ## Population's mapped into Summary Levels (pl)
      This maps every population p into any number of summary levels l
      summarized by the l Level level used. In this model higher
      levels mean more protection by convention, but that isn't necessary.
      You can also a given population row spread across different levels
      so that for instance a percentage of a population could go into
      different rows
    "Level Demand ln": |
      ## Population Demand by Summary Level for Resources (ln)
      This is the per capita demand for a set of n resources
      summarized by the l Summary Level used. It provides a view of demand
      aggregated by the summary level.
    "Population Total Demand pn": |
      ## Population Demand Resource pn
      This is the total demand for all p sub-Population for every resource n
    "Level Total Demand ln": |
      ## Total Demand for all Population Summary Levels for Resources (ln)
      For all L population summary levels, the total demand for a set
      of n resources
    "Level Total Cost ln": |
        ## Population Demand Total Cost by N Summary Levels
        For all L population summary levels, the total cost for a set of
        n resources
  "Resource n":
    "Resource Attribute na":
      - [1, 3, 1.5]
      - [1, 2, 0.7]
