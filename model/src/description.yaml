Description:
  "Population p":
    "Pop Detail pd": |
      ## Population Details (pd)
      There are p Populations in the model and each population
      can have d details about them such as their degree of age,
      ethnicity, attitudes and awareness behaviors
    "Protection pm": |
      ## Population to Protection Level (pm)
      For each p Populations falls into which protection
      category m for the burn rates
    "Population Demand pn": |
      ## Population Demand for each of n Resources (pn)
      This is the per capita demand for a give population so this is not the per
      capita demand but for every n Resource for ever subpopulation p
    "Pop to Level pl": |
      ## Population's mapped into Summary Levels (pl)
      This maps every population p into any number of summary levels l
      summarized by the l Level level used. In this model higher
      levels mean more protection by convention, but that isn't necessary.
      You can also a given population row spread across different levels
      so that for instance a percentage of a population could go into
      different rows
    "Level Demand ln": |
      ## Population Demand by Summary Level for Resources (ln)
      This is the per capita demand for a set of n resources
      summarized by the l Summary Level used. It provides a view of demand
      aggregated by the summary level.
    "Population Total Demand pn": |
      ## Population Demand Resource pn
      This is the total demand for all p sub-Population for every resource n
    "Level Total Demand ln": |
      ## Total Demand for all Population Summary Levels for Resources (ln)
      For all L population summary levels, the total demand for a set
      of n resources
    "Level Total Cost ln": |
        ## Population Demand Total Cost by N Summary Levels
        For all L population summary levels, the total cost for a set of
        n resources
  "Res Demand mn": |
    ## Protection by Level Demand for Resources aka Burn Rate (mn)
    The burn rates per capita for resources
    For example, 1.18 would mean you need 1.18 N95 masks per day for a
    given population
  "Resource n":
    "Res Detail na": |
        ## Resource Details (pa)
        For all n Resources, these are the figures for each of the a Attributes
        of each resource.
    "Pop Level Res Cost ln": |
        ## For Each Summary Level, the cost of Resoures
        For each of l summary levels, get the per capita cost for each of n
        Resources.
    "Res Inventory Initial ln": |
        ## Inventory by Population Summary Levels
        For each summarized population level l, this gives for every resource n
        the current inventory of each.
    "Res Inventory EOC ln": |
        ## Economic Order Quantity
        For each summarized population level l, this gives for every resource n
        the economic order quantity for reordering.
    "Res Inventory Safety Stock ln": |
        ## Safety Stock
        For each summarized population level l, this gives for every resource n
        the economic order quantity for reordering.
