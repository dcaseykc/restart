# Recoded Python model Studies

This takes the study done with Jupyter notebooks and turns it into code as a
demo:

## Model 0.0 feasibility of using Streamlit
This is the visual display demo using streamlit. Filled with dummy data

- [streamlit](streamlit) experiments with using Streamlit for web display.
- [model0/dashboard0.py](model0/dashboard0.py) is the spaghetti code that is the first implementation of the
  model. Retain for testing purposes

## Model that is the real python model first using streamlit as a demo v0.1

- [model0/dashboard.py[(model0/dashboard.py). This is not yet complete but
  implements the class model described in the readme
- [README.ipynb](README.ipynb). This is the main read me that describes how the
  module works. This is best read by starting https://colab.research.google.com
opening but it describes the equations and has the test code for the model.
 The main thing that it does is to make the variable names easy to understand.


## The real code for the Python model for v2.x
The other files follow the standard Python scheme and is ready for docstring
documentation
- [src](src) the source for the python. it's on the floor right now.
- [doc](doc) when we get documentation working we are using makedocs using
  docstring as the production tool.
