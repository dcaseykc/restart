# The 0.0 study of python working with streamlit

There are two ways to run this

```
python model.py
```

This will give the command line output and you can also run it with pdb

```
python -m pdb model.py
```

Then you can use streamlit to run this by importing model.py

```
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
