# The research notes

These come from various calls and document what we are learning

## Disinfection usages for Agricultural usage

The Trader Joe's working for 1.5 ounces for disinfectant. Feels that most
workers in agriculture are going to be at that level. As a retail store dealing
with food and so forth.

Pretty consistent across the distillers for 3/4 to 1 ounce

The State of Washington is not using sanitizer only for high traffic at entrance
of building not a replacement for hand washing. LNI not allowing sanitizer for
workplace safety. We petitioned for this particulary out in the field

Most users have a squeeze dispenser that is with them at all times with a
caribiner

Boeing is doing 175 gallon totes and then they refill it.

## Agricultural count analysis
30K H2A workers from foreign countries is a projection but so many border
problems.

164K Census is the most recent data and was recently updated. Bre will 

Remainder are WA domestic and then domestic workers.

Some of these are warehouses, apple packing, vegetable

Usage tempos. Many of outbreaks are in six feet. Some of the state rules. Have
300 different commodities in. You can use a single processor from Dan Coin.

1. Plants. 1 ounce per day
2. Warehouses. 
3. Fields. Agriculture workers. Farm labor

General forecast for what to order

Tom Dooley and Bre Elsey. The purpose of the forecast is to get a statewide need
assessment so that it knows if it were to procure enough for food safety then
what will they need to have. 

Having to buy what they need now. The purpose is to do an assessment.
