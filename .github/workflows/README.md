# Github Actions

These are basic CI/CD actions. The test first failed with the idea that you just
create a file in .github/workflow and it just works. This doesn't seem to be the
case. You have to create the file at https://github.com in the actions tab by
selecting new workflow. This uses the [XL Trail GitHub
Actions](https://www.xltrail.com/blog/how-to-manage-and-release-excel-files-on-github-part2) 

The sample uses `name` to give a name to the workflow section.


In the original XLTrail example it didn't work

So first we got the basic test to work
